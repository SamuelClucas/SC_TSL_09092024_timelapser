**Documentation Approach:**
These notebooks aim to document the rationale and functionality of the programme at successive 'Checkpoints'.

Within each 'Checkpoint x' folder, a notebook for every component of the programme is created to ensure comprehension of the code, and to discuss future improvements to be implemented in future checkpoints. 

The structure of each checkpoint folder will mimic the actual project structure at that stage, excluding empty files (like '__init__.py's for example). 

A short 'Summary.md' will be found in each checkpoint folder to briefly summarise the successes, failures, and next steps for the documented instance of the programme.


See [./Checkpoint_1/src/main.py](Checkpoint_1/src/main.py/) to start from the first functional instance of the programme.

For now, [CNN](CNN/) should be ignored.
